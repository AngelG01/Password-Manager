# Password-Manager
This is a password manager GUI application created using Python and the Tkinter library. The application allows users to generate strong passwords and save their login details for different websites, email accounts, or any other service that requires a username and password.

Features:
Generates a strong password of random length between 8-10 characters, consisting of letters (lowercase and uppercase), symbols, and numbers.
Saves the website name, email/username, and password to a json file (data.json) and creates it if there is no file.
The user can fill in the website name, email/username, and password in the respective text fields, and then click on the "Add" button to save the data to the text file.
Displays a message box to confirm the details entered by the user and save the data only if the user confirms the details.
